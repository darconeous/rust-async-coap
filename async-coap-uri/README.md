async-coap-uri: Safe, In-place URI Abstraction
==============================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/google/rust-async-coap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/google/rust-async-coap)
[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/async-coap-uri.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/async-coap-uri)
[![API](https://docs.rs/async-coap-uri/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/async-coap-uri)

This crate provides safe, efficient, full-featured support for using and
manipulating [Uniform Resource Identifiers][IETF-RFC3986].

It differs significantly from the [rust-url][] and [uri][rust-uri]
in that the API was designed to allow for more control over how
memory is allocated while also being more convenient to use.

[IETF-RFC3986]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986
[rust-url]: https://docs.rs/url
[rust-uri]: https://docs.rs/uri

What makes this crate unique is that it provides URI-specific types
that have the same unsized/sized type duality that is used for
`&str`/`String`, except with specific guarantees on the content,
as well as convenient domain-specific methods to access the URI
components. The API was designed to be easy-to-use while making as few
heap allocations as possible. Most common operations require no
allocations at all, and those that do are provided as a convenience
rather than a fundamental requirement. For example, you can parse and
fully percent-decode a URI without doing a single allocation, including
iterating over percent-decoded path segments and query key-value pairs.

See the [crate documentation](https://docs.rs/async-coap-uri) for more information.

## Usage ##

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
async-coap-uri = "0.1.0"
```

Now, you can use async-coap-uri:

```rust
use async_coap_uri::prelude::*;
```
