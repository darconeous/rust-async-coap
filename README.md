## Introduction ##

`rust-async-coap` is an experimental, asynchronous Rust library for
using and serving Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) resources.

This library provides a flexible, [asynchronous](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/futures-rs/)
interface for using and serving CoAP resources. A back-end that wraps around Rust's standard
`UdpSocket` is included, but can be replaced with one supporting DTLS, SMS, or whatever else
you might think of.

See the [crate documentation](https://docs.rs/async-coap) for more information.

## Usage ##

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
async-coap = "0.1.0"
```

Now, you can use rust-async-coap:

```rust
use async_coap::prelude::*;
```
